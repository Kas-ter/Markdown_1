## R Markdown

- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  
- When you click the **Knit** button a *document* will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
require(stats)
require(graphics)
summary(cars)
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (kmh)", ylab = "Distance (m)")
title(main="Car Stuff")
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "purple")
```

## Including Plots

- You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
lines(lowess(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure, f=1/200, iter=2), col="green")
```

- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
